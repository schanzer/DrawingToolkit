A javascript implementation of the Racket Drawing Toolkit.

Some functionality (notably dashed strokes) only works in FF8+ and WebKit Nightlies, though the vast majority should work in any browser with decent Canvas support. 

When browser support for the v5 Canvas API becomes widespread, a LOT of this code can be factored out. Specifically:
	- measureText
	- ellipse
	- arcTo
	- some of the Transformation pipeline stuff?

I'd wager this is at *least* 5% of the entire codebase.
